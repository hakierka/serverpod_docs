# ðŸ§± Build Your First App

This is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through creating your first full Serverpod app.

You'll learn how to:

- Create a new Serverpod project using the CLI
- Define your own server endpoints and data models
- Work with the database using Serverpodâ€™s ORM
- Add authentication and real-time updates
- Run your app locally and deploy it to the cloud

Each step builds on the last, and by the end you'll have a complete working backend running in Dart â€” and fully connected to a Flutter frontend.
