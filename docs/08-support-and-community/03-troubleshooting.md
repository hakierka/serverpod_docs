# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

Having trouble using Serverpod? Here are common issues and solutions to help you get back on track quickly.

## âš¡ Common Problems


### Flutter app fails to connect to the server
- **Check:** Is your server running on `http://localhost:8080/`?
- **Fix:** If running on a physical device, replace `localhost` with your machineâ€™s IP address.
- **Tip:** Use `flutter run --dart-define=SERVER_URL=http://<your-ip>:8080`.

### Dart `FormatException` when calling endpoints
- **Cause:** Input validation failed (e.g., out-of-bounds index).
- **Fix:** Make sure you send valid parameters to endpoints.

### Docker DB not reachable
- **Check:** Is Docker running?
- **Fix:** Try restarting Docker or running `docker compose up -d` again.
- **Note:** Wait a few seconds after DB starts before running migrations.

## ðŸ”§ Debugging Tips

- Use `print()` or logging in both Flutter and Serverpod to trace logic.
- Add `--apply-migrations` to your server run command during dev.
- Use Serverpod Insights to track performance and errors.
